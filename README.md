# PriceMarker
This a program that allows users to entre a web link (e.g. a Amazon link) that corresponds to an item (e.g. specific phone) and allows to track the price of the item, outputing a graph with the price and the item name. Each time the graph reloads the program checks if there is a new price and the user can see the change in price from old to new. If theres no change in price there wont be any new dots on the graph for that item. This program allows the user to create and reload different graphs.

At the moment:

- Works for some Amazon Links
- Works only for Amazon
- It cannot load / store

-----My Notes ----

1. Get given items (Done)
2. find them, get prices (Done)
3. print them off on a graph (Done)
4. Save graph - 1. Store it as a list / Dictionary then you redraw the old and new points.
5. Each time you run the program you get a choice to DELETE, CREATE NEW, LOOK AT SAVED GRAPHS 
5.5 If loading graph it shows old points and new
6. When you wanna LOOK at old graph it runs the program again giving the old and new dots / prices of the chosen objects
